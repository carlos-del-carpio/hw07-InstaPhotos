# hw07-InstaPhotos

This project highlights how to use a database in order to maintain an application like Instagram.

The application allows a user to create a new login profile or sign in to a previously made one.
Once inside their profile, they have the ability to upload pictures that are saved in FireStore.
Users can like and comment on pictures from other users and UI will update accordingly.
A user can also delete their own posts and comments.
